# generalsub
This repo contains several dictionary-powered solvers for general substitution ciphers.

simplesub.py is a very basic script which illustrates the general algorithm involved.

coroutinesub.py uses a very similar approach, but implements it with coroutines. Several other optimizations are also implemented.
